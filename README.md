This is a docker image with preinstalled ROS base packages as well as some that are common in robotics like Qt, OpenCV and Tesseract.

# Using this Image

The image doesn't provide a RUN command, so you should provide your own or use it with other tools like [industrial\_ci](https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci).
